# Pathfinder-Visualizer
* This is an interactive user-friendly pathfindiner visualization created using the A-Star Algorithm
* The programme is created using Pygame module
* Colour code:
   * Orange(255, 165 ,0) represents the start node
   * Turquoise(64, 224, 208) represents the end node
   * Green(0, 255, 0) represents the open nodes
   * Red(255, 0, 0) represents the closed nodes
   * Purple(128, 0, 128) represents the shortest path from the start node to the end node
